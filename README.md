# Assignment 5: Web HTML and CSS Prototypes (21 pts) Assigned: Wed Sep 19 2018
# Due: Mon Oct 1 2018 11:59pm'
# 
# To Do
# For the client that you based your Assignment 2 and 3, and based on the high-fidelity prototypes youcreatedinAssignment3​plustheresultsoftheheuristicevaluation(assignment4),​ you will create Web HTML/CSS Prototypes.
# 
# HTML:
#     1. Create HTML files for each of the 3 required pages:
#         a. (2 pts) ​The ​home page
#         b. (2 pts)​ The ​product browsing page​ that shows the variety of items the store has
#         c. (2 pts) ​The ​product detail page​ (​pick 1​ of the client’s products, and create a
# detail page for just that product. Make sure to show in the detail page the options that can be used on that product, i.e. color or size. Note: They do not need to be interactive, static HTML and CSS is ok for this assignment)
#     2. (2 pts) ​From the ​home page​, the other 2 pages should be reachable with an ​<a href=...> tag link.
#     3. (2 pts) ​Make sure each of the pages renders without error. Use the Developer Tools in Chrome to do this, and also use the ​HTML validator​ to validate your HTML file.
#     4. (2 pts) ​Indent and comment your code; follow the HTML style guides.
# CSS:
#     5. (2 pts) ​Create and include at least 1 CSS file.
#     6. (1 pts) ​Make sure the CSS file is well formatted and use the ​CSS validator​ to validate
# your CSS file.
#     7. (1 pts) ​Indent, comment and follow the CSS style guides.
# Both HTML + CSS:
#     8. (3 pts) ​These web prototypes should look as close to your high-fidelity digital mockup as
# possible. Certainly, you should implement in your web prototype what changes are
# necessary based on the heuristic evaluation (above).
#     9. Note: You can use VANILLA HTML/CSS code only; don’t use frameworks like Bootstrap
# or other libraries (you can “look at it” means you can look at how they do the HTML and
# CSS and format in a similar way, but DON’T import Bootstrap or other libraries).
#     10. Please cite any external resources you use.
# 
# Submission:
#     1. In your main Github PUI folder in your computer, create a new folder and call it homework_5​.
#     2. You should include all the files required in this write up in that folder.
#         a. HTML, CSS files.
#         b. Reflection file. The reflection can be pdf or MSword.
#     3. Make sure you do a ​git pull​ before you start working.
#     4. Always (for every change, big or small) do a:
#     5. The deadline for the Assignment is ​Mon Oct 1 2018 11:59pm​. We will count as your final submission the last ​git push​ before that time. Anything pushed after that date and time will be counted as late submission.
